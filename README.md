# Regular-encoding-versus-Huffman-Encoding

These are 2 files that each contain the code needed to do either the huffman encoding or a regular encoding. ReadPage is the regular encoding while minimumpriorityqueue is the huffman encoding. Along with each encoding, the number of bits each encoding uses is also returned. The node class is what each number is turned into in order to have other properties than just being a number.
